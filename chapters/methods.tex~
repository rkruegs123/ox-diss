FIXME: Congruences. We desire rewrite rules that won't make the graph about as complex but could lead to different extraction.

FIXME: Search procedures. Simulated annealing, genetic algorithms.

FIXME: Other, more general combinations (e.g., GA with all simps, or search with other ``safe'' procedures)
